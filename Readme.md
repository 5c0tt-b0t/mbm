MyBookmarkManager is a bash script CLI bookmark manager.
The first commit comes from the original post on http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/32jxeu/i_am_looking_for_a_specific_cli_bookmark_manager/ by user http://www.reddit.com/user/ibenchpressakeyboard

It originally relies on perl to extract the title, this dependency will be removed
